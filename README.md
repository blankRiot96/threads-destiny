Theme: Severed
Limitation: Multiple Endings

Game ideas:
* Central plane with a few different areas equally spaced from the center.
Each area is a different ending (maybe a type of death, or a way of life)
You avoid getting a thread severed on your way to an ending 
So there will be some projectiles around and you need to avoid them through a thread


Problems with this idea: Thread physics (maybe not?)
Solution: We don't need any fancy physics, just snappy threads!
